# Simple Calculator

A simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

## Features
Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Clear button to clear the input field
A display field to show the result of the calculation

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website here.

You will also need to have Tkinter library installed. It comes pre-installed with Python, but if for some reason it's not, you can install it using pip:

`pip install tk`

## Running the Calculator
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.


`git clone https://github.com/rohanali02/gui_calculator.git
cd gui_calculator`

Run the following command to start the calculator.

`python calculator.py`

## Built With
